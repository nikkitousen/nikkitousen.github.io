	<div class="abstract">
	<p>
	The increasing availability of personal computer systems, like smartphone and tablets, has given place to the development of 
	a broad new class of applications. These applications collect and analyze big amounts of information about its users for different 
	reasons, for instance: providing a personalized service, offering targeted advertisement, or providing accurate aggregated data for 
	research and analysis purposes. However, serious privacy concerns have been risen about the kind and quantity of data being collected: 
	this data is in general private by nature, and often it can be linked to other kinds of sensitive information. And in most cases, this 
	information is made available to an untrusted entity, either because the service provider itself is not reliable, or because some 
	aggregated information is being publicly released. In order to deal with these concerns, some kind of privacy guarantee is needed.  
	</p>

	<p>
	Differential Privacy is one of the most prominent frameworks used to deal with disclosure prevention in statistical databases. It provides 
	a formal privacy guarantee, ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred by disclosing answers to 
	aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent, i.e. differ only for an individual, then the query should not allow to tell them apart 
	by more than a certain factor. This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases, which is determined by their 
	distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation. 
	</p>

	<p>
	When the sensitive information to be protected is other than the value of a single individual, or when the secrets itself are not databases 
	at all, it is common to consider different notions of distinguishability. This distinguishability between secrets should depend on the 
	application at hand and the privacy guarantees we wish to express. For instance, when dealing with geographic locations, it might be 
	acceptable to disclose the fact that the user is in Paris rather than London. However, disclosing the precise location of the individual 
	within Paris is likely to be undesired. Thus it would be useful to have a distinguishability level that depends on the geographical distance.
	</p>

	<p>
	In the first part of this thesis we explore the implications of differential privacy when the indistinguishability requirement depends on 
	an arbitrary notion of distance. We show that we can naturally express, in this way, (protection against) privacy threats that cannot be 
	represented with the standard notion, leading to new applications of the differential privacy framework. We give intuitive characterizations 
	of these threats in terms of Bayesian adversaries, which generalize two interpretations of (standard) differential privacy from the literature. 
	We revisit the well-known results stating that universally optimal mechanisms exist only for counting queries: We show that, in our extended 
	setting, universally optimal mechanisms exist for other queries too, notably sum, average, and percentile queries.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In the second part of this thesis we introduce <i>geo-indistinguishability</i>, a formal notion of privacy for location-based systems that protects 
	the user's exact location, while allowing approximate information to be released. This privacy definition corresponds to an instance of the 
	generalized version of differential privacy presented before. We also show a mechanism for achieving Geo-indistinguishability and study different 
	issues that arise with its implementation, namely the truncation of the result and the effect of the precision of the machine. We also describe 
	how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS applications with geo-indistinguishability guarantees without compromising the quality of the application 
	results.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Finally, in the last part of this thesis, we consider the location privacy framework of Shokri et al, which offers an optimal trade-off between 
	the loss of quality of service and the privacy protection with respect to a given Bayesian adversary. We show that it is possible to combine the 
	advantages of this approach with ours: given a minimum threshold for the degree of geo-indistinguishability, we construct a mechanism that offers 
	the maximal utility, as the solution of a linear optimization problem. Thanks to the fact that geo-indistinguishability is insensitive to the 
	remapping of a Bayesian adversary, the mechanism so constructed is optimal also in the sense of Shokri et al. Furthermore we propose a method to 
	reduce the number of constraints of the linear program from cubic to quadratic (with respect to the number of locations), maintaining the privacy 
	guarantees without affecting significantly the utility of the generated mechanism. This lowers considerably the time required to solve the linear 
	program, thus enlarging significantly the size of location sets for which the optimal trade-off mechanisms can still be computed.
